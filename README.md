### Notes
#### Currently only works in Android Studio cause Expo SDK doesn't fully work with the libraries.  
Don't know if this is still necessary to run android build but not all the needed code is included in the expo sdk so its necessary.  
  
local.properties: Create a file named local.properties inside the android folder of your project. Add a line sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk where /path/to/your/android/sdk is the location of your Android SDK.
